      "[\"By 31 January, there were an estimated 1.9\\xa0million IDPs across six states\\xa0in northeast Nigeria,\\xa0an increase of 7% from the December assessment. The overall figure includes 1.5\\xa0million\\xa0in\\xa0Borno,\\xa0147,000\\xa0in Adamawa, and 113,000 in Yobe. 29.5%\\xa0of these IDPs have been displaced in 2016. 97% have been displaced due to the\\xa0BH\\xa0insurgency, and 3% due to communal clashes. 86.8% of IDPs originate from Borno, 5.7% from Adamawa, and 4.2% from Yobe.\\xa0\\xa0By the end of February it was reported that IDPs were increasingly moving from Maiduguri to newly accessible LGAs.\\xa0\\xa0This includes the 100 families that were returning per day to Damasak LGA in February.\\xa0\\n\\nCounter insurgency operations in Chibok, Damboa, Gwoza, Kala/Balge, Mafa and Monguno LGAs in Borno state Between 25 February and 1 March, at least 7,000 people were displaced from Chibok in Borno state due to renewed BH attacks. \\xa0Between 27 January and 10 February, military operations forced an estimated 8,000 people to flee Marte and 3,000 from Gwoza LGAs in Borno state. \\xa0Between December 2016 and early February,\\xa0a reported 10,000 people were forced to flee intercommunal\\xa0violence in\\xa0Ardo Kola, Gassol, and Lau LGAs in Taraba state.\\n\\nIDPs in camps have restricted movement and other people are not allowed to enter them.\\xa0\\xa0A November survey stated that 68% of camps in Yobe, Adamawa, and Borno\\xa0(149 camps) are without camp management.\\n\\nPeople arriving in Maiduguri, Borno state,\\xa0go first to a camp where they are screened by the army, then move on either to Mouna camp,\\xa0set up on\\xa0private land, or to Custom camp, which consists of unfinished buildings hosting between 2,000 and 3,000 people.\\xa0There are over 70,000 orphans living in Maiduguri and Monguno camps.\\xa0\\xa05% of all Borno IDPs are in camps; the remainder are in host communities.\\xa0On 31 October, cases of rape and exploitation of IDPs in camps by government officials came to light, prompting\\xa0President Buhari to launch an investigation, with no announcement of any results as of February 2017.\\xa0\\n\\nReturns and relocations\\n\\nAs of 31 January, there were approximately 1,099,500 returnees in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe states.\\xa0\\xa0Large numbers of IDPs are returning for many reasons, including overcrowding and a lack of food, water, and basic services in IDP camps. Approximately 400,000 have returned\\xa0to carry out farming.\\xa0\\xa0However, evidence also exists that IDPs are reluctant\\xa0to return home.\\xa0\\n\\nOn 21 February, the National Emergency Management Agency says about 310,000 IDPs have returned\\xa0to seven LGAs that have been retaken in the past few months\\xa0by the Nigerian army: 9,000 IDPs returned to Bama, 52,000 to Damboa, 67,000 from Dikwa, and 41,000 to Konduga.\\xa0\\xa0These areas have since come under increasing attacks on military and civilian positions. \\xa0Military access leading to improved access is the primary driver of IDP\\xa0returns.\\xa0\\n\\nIn Adamawa, the National Emergency Management Agency reported that IDP numbers in Yola LGA dropped from 60,000 to about 19,000 by November.\\xa0Over 3,000 refugees returned to Damasak town in Mobbar LGA, Borno, on 26 December.\\u200b On 28 December, the Adamawa state government announced that it plans to\\xa0close all of its IDP camps in January 2017; there are 21 camps in Adamawa that host approximately 11,757 people.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nIDP camp and community conditions\\xa0\\n\\nBaga: There is an estimated population of 45,000 in Baga. Farming and fishing is heavily limited due to military operations. Its only health facility is damaged. Housing is inadequate and IDPs are squatting in destroyed structures and compounds. There are\\xa0no education or sanitation facilities and prostitution\\xa0in order to gain food or money to survive\\xa0is taking place.\\n\\nBama:\\xa0Once the second most populous Borno town, it is now virtually deserted and\\xa0under army control. The entire population lives in the IDP camp, located in the hospital compound, hosting about 8,000 people. They live in makeshift shelters made of iron sheeting from destroyed housing in the surrounding area and are entirely dependent on outside assistance. Malnutrition levels have been brought below emergency threshold.\\n\\nBanki:\\xa0The town has between 20,000 and 25,000 people, most of whom are displaced. People are stranded in military-controlled camps and unable to leave due to military policy. They are entirely dependent on external assistance.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nDamboa:\\xa0The population is currently estimated to be at 88,000 with more than 8,600 displaced people living in three makeshift camps that are in public buildings and the general hospital. People continue to arrive regularly due to insecurity in the surrounding districts, even though\\xa0half the town has been destroyed in the insurgency. Food distributions began in November.\\n\\nDikwa:\\xa0An enclave controlled by the military with an estimated IDP population of 70,000, of which 21,000 are in the community and 49,000 are in its 14 camps. The people are almost entirely dependent on food assistance.\\xa0\\n\\n\\u200bGambaru:\\xa077,000 IDPs and returnees live in Gamboru and most are dependent on external assistance.\\xa0They have no access to healthcare as the only facility was destroyed and insecurity prevents them from seeking care elsewhere.\\xa0An October survey\\xa0showed 2.1% SAM and 6.4% MAM among children under five.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nGwoza: The town in eastern Borno is severely damaged and only accessible by helicopter. 45,000 IDPs are estimated to be living in the remaining buildings. Food, nutrition, and health are the priority needs with high rates of malnutrition and malaria.\\xa0\\n\\nKonduga: On 16 March a fire killed three people and caused considerable damage to the camp, where 6,200 people are hosted.\\xa0\\n\\nMaiduguri: Maiduguri's population has swelled to over two million, half of whom\\xa0are IDPs. Muna Garage camp is receiving the bulk of new IDPs and army-aided returns to areas\\xa0of origin have slowed as fighting re-escalated at the end of October.\\n\\nMonguno:\\xa0Monguno has a current estimated population of\\xa0225,000, with 68,000 IDPs in the LGA's nine camps and 60,000 in host communities. Malaria, respiratory tract infections and measles were the main illnesses treated in the IDP camp and there is limited healthcare\\xa0throughout the LGA.\\n\\nNgala:\\xa0As of 13 November, 56,000 IDPs\\xa0living in a camp\\xa0lack\\xa0sanitation and water facilities and rely on food assistance.\\xa0A screening in October showed 8.5% SAM and 14.3% MAM among children under five.\\xa0\\n\\nNganzai:\\xa0As of mid-November, 5,500 IDPs live in three different locations, up from 3,100 in August. 8,200 returnees also live in the area. In Gajiram, which hosts 2,000 IDPs, there is no sanitation or education facilities, and IDPs rely on a sole water point. In Gasarwa and Burimari, open-defecation is a common practice\\xa0as there are\\xa0no WASH facilities.\\xa0 \\xa0\\n\\nPulka:\\xa0Pulka hosts over 30,000 people and is only accessible by helicopter. Health is a high need.\\n\\nRann:\\xa0Around 43,000 people are displaced in Rann and access is limited due to poor roads and insecurity. It has only become accessible at all in the latter months of 2016. Serious food shortages and malnutrition has been reported.\\xa0\\n\", 'Ecuador:\\xa0171,500 refugees.\\xa0\\n\\nCosta Rica:\\xa016,620 refugees and 210 asylum seekers;\\n\\nPanama:\\xa015,550 refugees and 800 asylum seekers;\\n\\nVenezuela:\\xa05,000 refugees, 168,500 unregistered refugees and 250 asylum seekers. The precarious economic and political situation in Venezuela means that Colombian refugees are likely to be lacking access to basic supplies including food and\\xa0medicine.\\n', 'More than 120,000 mostly Columbian refugees currently reside in Ecuador, predominantly in the north of the country. Limited economic opportunities add to their vulnerability, and could present an additional obstacle to recovering from any impacts of the 16 and 18 April earthquakes.\\n', 'Between 2 and 5 January, clashes between the Taliban and government forces displaced 7,200 people in Faryab Province. They are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance due to the winter weather, notably emergency shelters, food, safe water sanitation facilities and basic health care.\\n\\nMore than 1.5\\xa0million people were internally displaced in Afghanistan as of 28 October 2016. Displacement has taken place in 31 of the 34 provinces. More than half of the newly displaced are children.\\xa0\\n', 'Around 6,000 people were displaced due to violent intercommunal clashes in Bouna town\\xa0beginning in\\xa0March. Over 3,000 were displaced internally, but many are now returning, with latest figures reporting 1,850 IDPs as of 23 May. Returns are limited to urban IDPs; people displaced from villages surrounding Bouna town are yet to head home.2,200 fled to Burkina Faso. The displaced Fulani herders have brought thousands of cattle with them, which has caused tensions with Burkinabe host communities.  Over 700 Ivorians fled to Ghana, but as of mid-May most were returning.\\n', 'As of 28 February, the political crisis has displaced over 404,000 Burundians to neighbouring countries since April 2015, including more than 40,000 in December 2016 and January 2017.\\xa0Burundi hosts\\xa037,000 returnees, 58,000 DRC refugees, and 169,000 IDPs. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0The number of Burundian refugees\\xa0is projected to exceed 524,000 by the end of 2017.\\n', 'From Kenya\\n\\nAs of 28 February, over 52,500 Somali refugees have returned home since 8 December, 2014. \\xa0The rate of\\xa0returnees from Kenya has increased in 2016, following the announcement by the Kenyan government that it would\\xa0close the Dadaab refugee camps:\\xa033,725 Somalis\\xa0returned from Kenya in 2016, compared to 6,000 in all 2015.\\xa0However, on 9 February the High Court of Kenya announced that the closure of Dadaab was unconstitutional, and blocked closure.\\xa0Although returnees are likely to continue to Somalia in 2017, this move will stop large-scale returns.\\xa0\\n\\nWhile most returnees are from the Dadaab camps, 550 Somalis were returned from Kakuma camp in 2016. \\u200b\\xa074% of Somali refugees say\\xa0that they are not willing to return yet.
